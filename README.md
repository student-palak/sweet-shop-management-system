## My AI Usage

I used AI tools (ChatGPT) as a development assistant during this project.

### How I used AI
- To understand the assessment requirements clearly
- To generate initial test case templates following TDD
- To debug issues related to Jest, Supertest, and Express routing
- To validate my approach for REST API design and commit structuring

### How AI helped my workflow
AI helped me speed up development and catch errors early, but all core logic,
design decisions, test validations, and final implementations were written,
understood, and verified by me.

I treated AI as a productivity and learning aid, not as a replacement for
problem-solving or understanding the code.
